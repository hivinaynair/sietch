/// @notice Publishes a commitment to a compliance decision. The decision record and its salt live

///
/// A commitment is a hash of the decision record plus a random salt. Publishing it proves two
/// things at once: that a decision existed, and that it existed *at this moment* — the block
/// timestamp is the notary. It reveals nothing about the decision. Anyone later handed the record
/// and the salt can hash them and check they match what is on chain, which makes the record
/// tamper-evident without ever having been public. The salt is what stops an observer from simply
/// guessing a record and hashing it to confirm.
///
/// V1 of this contract put the payer, the payment hash, the amount and the identity status directly
/// in the event, which meant the whole compliance book was readable by anyone. This version
/// deliberately omits all of it.
///
/// Note the limit: the USDC transfer itself is still public. This hides the compliance book, not
/// the payment — and it hides it from observers, not from the facilitator, who holds the record.
/// See docs/plans/2026-08-16-privacy-primitive.md.
///
/// Not on the Foundry `src` path — built by `bun metal:compile-contracts` and deployed by
/// `bun metal:deploy-contracts`, both in `packages/metal-scripts`.
